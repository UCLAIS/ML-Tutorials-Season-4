    "In this challenge you will be explore training and inferring using neural networks. You've already seen how to use classifiers in the previous challenge on premier league prediction. Now we will look at a regression task. Simply put, instead of trying to predict from a set of discrete classes, we are predicting a continuous value. In this case we will predict the alcohol content of wine based on a set of other chemical attribute.\n",
